Extreme-scale Distribution-based Data Analysis Library

Project goal: A framework for distribution data anaysis and visualization.

Required components:

1. Generic distribution data model.  

2. 3D data fields containing the distribution data at each point.

3. Creation and I/O of distribution data.

4. Basic visualizaiton routines for distribution data. 

## Current goal
Complete a generic data management framework so that in the future we can build uncertainty visualization given any known distribution model.
